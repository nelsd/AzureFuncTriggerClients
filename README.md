Solution to trigger Azure Functions via calling various services endpoints

This has taken from the original link below

I have tweaked it in a certain way to work with my use case.

Changes done: 

    1.> Take a folder which has json file or payload which needs to be send to EH. Added a few more fields to it and then send it to EH endpoint. - 22 Jan 2019
